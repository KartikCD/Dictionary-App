## About

Word Search is an Android application which helps to search meaning of the word. The application also provides functionality of Word Pronounciation which is clear, completely-natural, pre-recorded by native speakers.

Right now, I have provided functionality to search meaning of word in english only. Multiple languages meaning search functionality will be implemented soon as I get completed with my other projects.

This was my first app where I used Dependency Injection with Hilt
